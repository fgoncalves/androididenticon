# Android Identicon

A simple 5x5 identicon generator for Android backed up by RxJava

Take a look at [this app](https://github.com/fgoncalves/identicon.android) for
an example of an app using this library.

Here are some examples generated by the library:

![identicon](/art/identicon.png?raw=true "Identicon 1")
![identicon2](/art/identicon2.png?raw=true "Identicon 2")
![identicon3](/art/identicon3.png?raw=true "Identicon 3")

## Simple Usage

```kotlin
val identicon: Identicon = IdenticonImpl()
identicon.generate("foobar")
    .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
    .subscribe({
         // do someting with the bitmap which is an identicon for foobar
    },
    { /* error */})
```

## How does it work?

The identicon algorithm is very basic. It's md5 based, meaning
the same input will always generate the same identicon.

The algorithm computes the md5 hash of the given input. Uses the first
3 bytes for the values of rgb for the colour and drops the last byte so we
work with only 15 bytes. These makes it easier to chunk the list into 3 bytes
and mirror each chunk. The coloured values are the even bytes.

## Caveats & limitations

For now you can only generate identicons that are 250x250 pixels. Moreover
the generated identicon will only be a 5x5 identicon.
